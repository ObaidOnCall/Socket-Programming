# WebSocket Server Example

This repository contains a simple WebSocket server implemented in Java. The server establishes a single WebSocket connection, performs the necessary handshake, and handles basic message communication.

## Overview

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. This example demonstrates how to set up a WebSocket server that can accept one connection, perform the WebSocket handshake, and exchange messages with a client.

## Features

- Establish a WebSocket connection
- Perform WebSocket handshake
- Receive and send messages
- Close the connection gracefully

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- A WebSocket client for testing (e.g., Postman, a web browser, or a custom client)
